# dash-bootstrap-components

[Plotly Dash][dash-homepage] is great! However, creating the initial
layout can create a lot of boilerplate. *dash-bootstrap-components*
reduces this boilerplate by providing standard layouts and high-level
components.

*dash-bootstrap-components* provides [Bootstrap][bootstrap-homepage]
components. It is built on top of [reactstrap][reactstrap-homepage].
